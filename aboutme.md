My name is Danielle Reher and I am passionate about gardening and helping others grow their passion for gardening.

### My story

I grew up in Fargo, ND and while I've always loved the outdoors, I didn't start gardening until about 15 years ago. What began with a small plot of hot peppers (since most everything else wilted and died), has flourished into a swath of vegetables, fruits, and nut trees and help me provide local, healthy food for myself and those that I love the most.
