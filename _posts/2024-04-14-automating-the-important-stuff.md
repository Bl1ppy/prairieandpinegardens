Let's say that hypothetically, you didn't want your entire life to revolve around your garden. I know: outlandish notion that you might have other priorities/interests/obligations, right?

So much of gardening can succeed or fail on doing the right thing at the right time. Beyond the obvious of (typically) planting in the spring and (generally) harvesting in the fall, there are numerous 'tasks' in gardening that have to happen in preparation of (planning, ordering seeds, anticipating germination), and throughout the growing season (water, pruning, trellising, pest mitigation). 

What if I told you that you could take a back seat to some of those steps?
